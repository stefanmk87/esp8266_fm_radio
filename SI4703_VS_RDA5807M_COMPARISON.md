**Si4703:**
```
RF ‚Üí Mixer ‚Üí IF ‚Üí DSP ‚Üí 24-bit DAC ‚Üí Audio Out
                          ‚Üë
                    Premium Sigma-Delta DAC
                    THD < 0.5%
                    SNR > 60 dB
```

**RDA5807M:**
```
RF ‚Üí Mixer ‚Üí IF ‚Üí DSP ‚Üí 16-bit DAC ‚Üí Audio Out
                          ‚Üë
                    Basic DAC
                    THD < 1%
                    SNR ~55 dB
```

**Result:** Si4703 has **cleaner, more detailed audio!**
